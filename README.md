# 100DaysOfCode
In this repository I talk about 100-Days-Of-Code. What is it? Why is it? How to get started? 
Do not worry, answering all the queries here.

## What is #100DaysOfCode?
#100DaysOfCode is an infamous challenge/community among developers or anybody who codes. It invloves an open commitment to code for at least 1 hour everyday! 

## Prerequisites for #100DaysOfCode
* Have at least 1 hour to spare **everyday** for the next 100 days.
* A blogging page ready for yourself. It could be on [Medium](https://medium.com/) or anywhere you like.

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) account so that you can push your everyday progress on GitHub.

## What do people do in these #100DaysOfCode?
Since I belive in learning bit-by-bit, for me this challenge is more than JUST coding. In my version of #100DaysOfCode I follow my own rule i.e. **Learn**. LEARN any tech stack. Not necessarily be coding everyday but very necessarily be learning some tech stack. It could be learning some language from a book, some development course, maybe making up my own project, contributing to open source projects or simply practicing technical writing.

## Why is there a need of #100DaysOfCode?
* Public commitment always helps you to stay on track. I believe that commiting publicly anchors me to my roots and I perform better. I'm sure it works for 90% out there!
* **Connect** with like-minded people. Taking up #100DaysOfCode challenge is the best way you to connect with awesome developer communities out there on Twitter/Slack/etc.
* To stay **disciplined**. There is surely no better way to be disciplined than practicing code for at least an hour everyday.
* Enhancing your **tech stack**. Being a Computer Science student I very well understand the need of enhancing my tech stacks in every direction I possibly can. 
* Building up a good **coding habits**.
